# Development History

## 2025-04-05: Dependency Resolution

### Issue
Encountered dependency conflict when running `npm install`:
```
npm error code ERESOLVE
npm error ERESOLVE unable to resolve dependency tree
npm error
npm error While resolving: my-v0-project@0.1.0
npm error Found: react@19.1.0
npm error node_modules/react
npm error   react@"^19" from the root project
npm error
npm error Could not resolve dependency:
npm error peer react@"^16.8 || ^17.0 || ^18.0" from vaul@0.9.9
```

### Files Modified
- package.json

### Changes Made
```json
// Changed React versions from 19 to 18
"react": "^18",
"react-dom": "^18",
"@types/react": "^18",
"@types/react-dom": "^18"
```

### Explanation
The error occurred because the `vaul` package requires React versions 16.8, 17.0, or 18.0, but the project was using React 19. Downgrading React to version 18 resolves the dependency conflict while maintaining compatibility with all other packages.
