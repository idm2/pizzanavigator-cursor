### Toppings Data Enhancement

1. **Created comprehensive toppings markdown data**
   - Added `data/complete-pizza-toppings-markdown.md` with 60 detailed pizza topping recipes
   - Each recipe includes name, tags, ingredients (with amounts and units), and method steps
   - Organized into 6 categories: Classic, Mediterranean & Specialty, Gourmet Combinations, International Flavors, Creative Combinations, and Gourmet Specialties

2. **Created conversion script**
   - Added `scripts/convert-toppings.js` to convert markdown to JSON format
   - Script extracts recipe names, tags, ingredients, and method steps
   - Properly parses ingredient amounts, units, and names
   - Generates structured data for all 60 topping recipes

3. **Updated toppings data file**
   - Updated `data/toppings-data.json` with the new complete set of topping recipes
   - Standardized the structure of toppings data
   - Organized ingredient information with consistent amount, unit, and name properties
   - Simplified method steps into an array of instructions
   - Added comprehensive categorization with 18 topping categories

4. **Previous updates to components**
   - Updated `utils/toppings-utils.ts` to handle the new data format
   - Modified `components/toppings-detail-page.tsx` to display detailed recipe information
   - Updated `components/pizza-plan-summary.tsx` to show unique toppings and remove "As needed" text
   - Enhanced `components/pizza-toppings-selector.tsx` to use categorized toppings

### To-Do:
- Consider adding images for each topping recipe
- Add nutritional information to recipes
- Implement filtering by dietary restrictions (vegan, gluten-free, etc.)
